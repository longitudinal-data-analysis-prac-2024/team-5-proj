# team-5-project

> This is a Team 5 project. We aimed to investigate the effect of maternal depression on children's cortisol levels which were measured repeatedly. To this end, we extracted measurements of the DSM-IV diagnosis of lifetime maternal depression and children's reactive cortisol levels from the Children's Experiences and Development Study (Jaffee et al., 2015). Multilevel models were used to analyse the data.

# **Introduction**

Bleker et al. (2020) have found little evidence supporting an association between maternal depression and altered cortisol levels in children. Based on evidence from 10 studies, prenatal depression appeared to have no or weak association with stress response in children.

# Methods

**Participants**

Four hundred children were recruited from the National Evaluation of Sure Start's study. Children were first seen at the age of 3, and followed up at the age of 8 to 10.

**Procedure**

Cortisol level: cortisol was assessed from saliva samples, which were collected 20 minutes, 10 minutes, and at the end of the Social Provocation Task. At least 1 ml of passive drool was collected from participants.

Social Provocation Task: the task lasted for approximately minutes. Children were told they were going to play a video game against an opponent, who was actually a confederate. The task intended to provoke anger, frustration, and embarrassment in children. Children were instructed to undergo a practice round and two competitive rounds. Children were required to move the cursor to a target on the screen as quickly and accurately as possible. The practice round was designed so that the children performed poorly. The competitive rounds were designed so that the opponent always scored more points than the child could score in the previous rounds. Each round including the practice round finished with derogatory comments about the child's poor performance.

Children and parents were debriefed at the end of the study, but children were unaware that the game was manipulated.
